/*Imagine you and your friend have brought different snacks for lunch. However, you want to
 exchange your snacks with each other. To do this, you decide to enlist the help of a friend who can hold
  one snack box while you exchange with your other friend. Similarly, in programming, we can use a third variable to help us swap the values
   of two variables.*/
